resolve-flatpak
===============

This repo allows you to package DaVinci Resolve as a Flatpak for use on Linux Flatpak
based systems, especially e.g. Fedora Silverblue where there aren't easier installation
options. 

It's still a work-in-progress; but "works-for-me[tm]" right now.

Usage
-----

1. If you have appimagelauncherd (the AppImage Launcher daemon) installed and enabled, you NEED to temporarely disable it (either through systemctl or through the AppImage Launcher GUI) as it conflicts with flatpak-builder during the .run file repackaging process.

2. Clone this repo with: `git clone https://github.com/pobthebuilder/resolve-flatpak.git --recursive`
By default, com.blackmagicdesign.Resolve.Free.yaml is configured to package the latest version of Resolve (18.5 Beta 3 at the time of writing).

3. Build your package, and export to a distributable single file installer:

#### Free
```
flatpak-builder --force-clean --repo=repo build-dir com.blackmagicdesign.Resolve.Free.yaml
flatpak build-bundle repo resolve.flatpak com.blackmagicdesign.Resolve.Free
```
#### Studio
```
flatpak-builder --force-clean --repo=repo build-dir com.blackmagicdesign.Resolve.Studio.yaml
flatpak build-bundle repo resolve.flatpak com.blackmagicdesign.Resolve.Studio
```

4. Enjoy.
